                            <p> The Cybertruck has arrived and it looks nothing like any pickup truck you've ever seen.
                                Tesla
                                CEO Elon Musk revealed the long-awaited electric pickup truck at its Design Studio in
                                Hawthorne, California, just outside Los Angeles.

                                When the truck initially drove onto the stage, many in the crowd clearly couldn't
                                believe that
                                this was actually the vehicle they'd come to see. The Cybertruck looks like a large
                                metal
                                trapezoid on wheels, more like an art piece than a truck.
                                The most expensive version of the truck, the Tri Motor All-Wheel-Drive, will be able to
                                carry
                                3,500 pounds, tow up to 14,000 pounds and go from zero to 60 in 2.9 seconds. It will
                                also be
                                able to drive up to 500 miles on a full charge. Base models will have a range of 250
                                miles.
                                In addition to being able to carry cargo in its bed, the truck will have lockable
                                storage
                                spaces under the hood and in the sides. The bed itself also has a sliding cover. Drivers
                                will
                                also be able to adjust the ride height of the truck, for when they are on the highway or
                                off-road, using an adaptive air suspension system.

                        <h1 style=" font-family: 'Rock Salt', cursive; color: white;">HIV AIDS</h1>
                        <p style=" font-family: 'Rock Salt', cursive; color: white;"> Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
                            is a virus that attacks immune cells called CD4 cells,
                            which
                            are a type of T cell.

                            These are white blood cells that move around the body, detecting faults and anomalies in
                            cells
                            as well as infections. When HIV targets and infiltrates these cells, it reduces the body's
                            ability to combat other diseases.

                            This increases the risk and impact of opportunistic infections and cancers. However, a
                            person
                            can carry HIV without experiencing symptoms for a long time.

                            HIV is a lifelong infection. However, receiving treatment and managing the disease
                            effectively
                            can prevent HIV from reaching a severe level and reduce the risk of a person passing on the
                            virus.
                            AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. Once HIV infection develops into AIDS,
                            infections and cancer pose a greater risk.

                            Without treatment, HIV infection is likely to develop into AIDS as the immune system
                            gradually
                            wears down. However, advances in ART mean than an ever-decreasing number of people progress
                            to
                            this stage.

                            By the close of 2015, around 1,122,900 people were HIV-positive. To compare, figures from
                            2016
                            show that medical professionals diagnosed AIDS in an estimated 18,160 people.

                            belief in Jurgen Klopp's men
                            grows
                        </H1>
                        <p style=" font-family: 'Rock Salt', cursive; color: white;"> Jurgen Klopp grinned, his bright
                            white teeth gleaming under the floodlights as he walked off
                            the
                            Anfield pitch thumping
                            the badge on his chest and soaking up the adulation of the fans in the stands. This was not
                            a
                            vintage Liverpool
                            performance, but it was a vital win and he knew it.

                            A couple of hours earlier, news of Jonjo Shelvey's late equaliser for Newcastle against
                            Manchester City had spread
                            across the stadium. Liverpool knew victory here would take them 11 points clear of their
                            rivals.
                            It was an opportunity
                            they were not expecting but one they had to take.
                            Virgil van Dijk's goals - two headers from Trent Alexander-Arnold deliveries in the space of
                            six
                            first-half minutes -
                            put them in a commanding position, a position from which it seemed they might run wild. But
                            Brighton refused to lie
                            down. When Alisson Becker was sent off and Lewis Dunk guided the resulting free-kick past
                            Adrian, it felt like Liverpool
                            might crumble.
                            According to Opta, Liverpool have now scored 40 goals from set pieces since the start of
                            last
                            season. It is more than
                            any other side in the Premier League. Van Dijk's towering frame can be impossible to defend
                            against and he is not their
                            only threat either. In the same time-frame, they have scored 29 headed goals. No other
                            Premier
                            League side has managed
                            more than 19.
